                <p>Would I rather be feared or loved? Easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me.</p>
                <p>I saved a life. My own. Am I a hero?â€¦ I really can't say, but yes!</p>
                <p>Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked, but it's not like this compulsive need to be liked, like my need to be praised.</p>
                <p>Sometimes I'll start a sentence, and I don't even know where it's going. I just hope I find it along the way.</p>
